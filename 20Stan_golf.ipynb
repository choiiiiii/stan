In this case, though, it doesn’t really matter, given how tiny these errors are: their estimated standard deviation is less than one percentage point.\n",

In theory it would be possible to estimate either or both these parameters from the data. In practice, no way. The model already fits the data so well (as shown by the above graph) that there’s clearly no more information available to estimate any additional parameters. If we were to do so, the estimates would be highly noisy and unstable (if their prior is weak) or highly dependent on the prior (if an informative prior distribution is specified). Either way we don’t see the advantage of this sort of fit.\n",
